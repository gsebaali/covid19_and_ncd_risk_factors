__Problem:__
Building an NCD-vulnerability index that is calculated from risk factors and NCD prevalence indicators.

 
This will serve in raising awareness on COVID-19 NCD links (advocacy), spurring debate, and informing policy decisions (possibly at a later stage, as we acquire better data and improve the index).
